Description: Heimdal Kerberos - key distribution center (KDC)
 Heimdal is a free implementation of Kerberos 5 that aims to be
 compatible with MIT Kerberos.
 .
 This package includes the KDC (key distribution center) server,
 which is designed to run on a secure computer and keeps track
 of users' passwords. This is done using the Kerberos protocol in
 such a way that the server computers do not need to know the
 passwords.

Description: Heimdal Kerberos - Multi-implementation Development
 Heimdal is a free implementation of Kerberos 5 that aims to be
 compatible with MIT Kerberos.
 .
 This package provides versions of the Heimdal development files that
 can be installed along-side MIT Kerberos development files.
 Normally, heimdal-dev should be used. However if a package needs to
 build  against both Heimdal Kerberos and MIT Kerberos, then the
 multidev package should be used.
